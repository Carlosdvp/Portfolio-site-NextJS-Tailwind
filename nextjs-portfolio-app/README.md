## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## Steps

### I. Homepage and setup

1. Create next app selecting the desired options
2. Remove unneeded boilerplate code
3. Install packages
4. Start by creating and styling the following components:
    - Navbar
    - Logo
    - Social Icons
5. Add an AI generated profile picture for the Homepage
6. Style the homepage
7. Add a component for the animated text on the Homepage
8. Animate the text on the homepage ith the 'framer-motion' library
9. Add a button to download Resume and a link to send an email
10. Create a Footer component
11. Go to Canva and create an circular text icon, donwload as png
    - remove background at remove.bg
    - convert to svg at Adobe.com/express
12. Use svg to create the spinning text component for the Hireme button

### II. About page

1. Create the About me page
2. add biograhy and a profile picture
3. Add Skills and style that section with css functions and framer motion
4. Add the Experience component
5. Add scrolling animation to the experience section
    - https://www.framer.com/motion/scroll-animations/
6. Add circle icons for the Elements of the Experience list
    - adding the 'ListIcon' mini component has an odd breaking effect on the list items, it pushes some to the right more than others.
    - I will create the component for future reference but will not add it to the website for now
    - UPDATE: well, as it turns out as soon as I made them into svg's their behavior is what was expected, moving forward with it.
